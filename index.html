		<h2>About Me </h2>
		<p>	My name is Skylar Fulcher, I am twenty years old and I am from Virginia Beach, VA. I graduated high school in June, 2021 from Ocean Lakes High School. From the age of six to the present day I have been riding horses. I have competed all over the East coast and currently have two horses of my own, however I am in the process of selling one of them and the other is a very small pony who is getting on the older side. We lease the small pony out to really young kids who are learning how to ride. </p>

	<p id="aboutextra" class="hidden">I study biology and I also have a chemistry minor. Although I have spent the past years waiting tables at a few restaurants, I have really been trying to get a hospital job lately so that I can add more relevant job experience to my resume for graduate school applications. </p>

		<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
		<p>I currently have a Summer, Fall, and Spring semester left until I graduate in May 2024. I plan to begin graduate school applications very soon, and I hope to get into a Cardiac Perfusion masters program. My top two schools are MUSC in Charleston and Vanderbilt in Nashville. The programs are very competitive to get into, so I anticipate taking a few gap years as I gain relevant job experience and work on my resume.</p>

	<p id="careerextra" class="hidden">Assuming that I do eventually get into a graduate school program, I hope to become a cardiac perfusionist. This is the person in the operating room during open heart surgery that operates the heart-lung machine. This machine stops the heart and takes over circulation. </p>
